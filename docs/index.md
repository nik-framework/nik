# Getting Started

Nik is a modern fullstack framework for building single page web applications (SPAs) using only Python. Nik inherits some of the best parts of JavaScript based UI Frameworks and combines it with Python's simplicity.

Nik is opinionated and yet it doesn't force you to use any of those opinions. :)

## Main Features

- ASGI based server.
- File based routing.
- Html via Python classes.
- Client side reactivity and state management without JavaScript.
- Automatic parameter injection on routes.
- Nested layouts.
- Authentication, authorisation and session management integrated at the core level.
